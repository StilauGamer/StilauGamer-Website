                <h2>School Website</h2>
                <p>
                    One of my projects is my school's website. My school is currently working on their very own website.
                    And after looking through the students going on my school they found out that they wanted to ask me if I wanted to help with it.
                    Currently I have not started fully on coding the website, but I have started on planning out how it will be.

                <h2>My Official Website</h2>
                <p>
                    I also have this website as a project. I am currently coding on this website at school and at home.
                    This website is currently planned out to be my official website. My website started first out as a bootstrap studios website,
                    Before I realised that it is better off making a brand new one that is fully custom coded by me.
